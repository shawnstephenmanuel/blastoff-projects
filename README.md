# This is a repository of projects I started at the beginning of my coding/Python journey. 
# In order, my first project ideas were:
#   1- A landing menu that launches on login and offers to open a programmable list of websites or apps
#   2- A recreation of the statistical analyses and visualizations from my psych undergrad honours thesis
# ...and that's about it for now
# but rest assured more is to come !
